`udf_tutorial.ipynb` - Walkthrough of how to define and apply UDFs in base Python, Pandas, and PySpark.

UDF’s are used to extend the functions of the framework and re-use these functions on multiple DataFrames. For example, you wanted to convert every first letter of a word in a name string to a capital case; PySpark build-in features don’t have this function hence you can create it a UDF and reuse this as needed on many DataFrames. UDF’s are once created they can be reused on several DataFrames and SQL expressions.
